# Word Analyzer Microservice

This microservice processes word-based commands and returns analysis results such as word length, vowel count, and repeated letter count.

##  How to Request Data from the Microservice:

To request data, send a **POST request** to the `/analyze` endpoint with a **JSON body** containing a command and a word.

## Example Request (Python)

import requests

url = "http://127.0.0.1:5000/analyze"
data = {"command": "length", "word": "dog"}

response = requests.post(url, json=data)
print(response.json())  # Expected output: {"result": 3} 

## How to Receive Data from Microservice:

The microservice will return a JSON response containing the requested analysis. Below are example responses:

## Example Response (Success)
json

{"result": 3}

Example Response (Error Handling)
If an incorrect format is sent:

json
{"error": "Missing command or word"}
